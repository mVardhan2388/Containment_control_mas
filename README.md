This paper investigates containment control under differential privacy and quantization. Followers follow a modified Friedkinâ€“Johnsen (F-J) model. Simulations show that despite added Laplacian noise and limited precision due to quantization, followers successfully converge within the convex hull formed by reference agents, validating the proposed approach.
